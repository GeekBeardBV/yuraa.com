When you walk the streets of big cities (especially in EU) you see a lot of buildings, bridges, constructions of any kind that were painted when they were built. The paint was used either for protection from the elements, or for the style, or both.

Time passes, days fly by, years run through... And the elements do their job - they destroy the paint, the color fades, cracks appear, etc.

Actually there is also one more "element" = people. Graphities, tagging and other types of personal expression that ends up on walls for all of us to admire.

Maintenance crews try to freeze the time, by maintaining the overall looks of these objects, by patching out the areas which were damanged.

But here is a noticable challenge: **They never get the color right**

Sure, original color faded at the very least. If you were to use the same exact paint, it wouldn't match. But In most cases you could see that the difference is a little too drastic.

This always made me think that the task of patching the spot had a loosly specified guidance on preserving it's original state.

And made me always wonder, how would the conversation go between the building owner (or whoever ordered the repair and possibly paid for it) and the contractors / city services who actaully "did the job".

Here I present you the rest of my humble collection, that I started calling:

### Fleating Pantone
_Because no one seem to be able to catch the right one..._
